# Antarctica Global Associate Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

In this project, we conducted an analysis of employee performance metrics using a dataset that includes 'Date,' 'Leads,' 'Time_Spent,' and 'Associate' information. We addressed missing values through forward fill imputation and by removing incomplete rows. Visualizations, including line charts, were employed to identify trends in employee performance.

A Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model was applied for time series analysis, considering both seasonal and non-seasonal data components. This model was utilized to forecast the number of leads generated in the upcoming month, providing point forecasts and confidence intervals to represent the predicted values and their uncertainty.

The SARIMA model's performance was evaluated on both training and testing data, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting leads.

## Dataset Overview

- The dataset comprises 267 entries.
- Missing values in 'Leads' and 'Time_Spent' were addressed through forward fill imputation and row removal.
- Data distribution is close to normal, with minimal outliers.

## Key Insights

- Employee performance metrics indicate positive trends in lead generation.
- Lead generation fluctuates over time, suggesting seasonality.
- Point forecasts consistently exceed actual leads, with improving prediction accuracy.

## Recommendations for the Business Development Team

1. Investigate Associate ABC's performance, assess the allocation of time to non-revenue activities.
2. Learn from Associate XYZ's successful lead generation techniques and share insights with the team.
3. Provide training and support to Associate KLM and assist in targeting the right leads.
4. Emphasize quality over quantity in lead generation activities.

## Goal for May 12, 2023

- Prioritize effective lead generation techniques.
